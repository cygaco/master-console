The Lua-script ledger is node-atomic but a leader failover can silently lose the last few hundred ms of writes. For Stripe webhook idempotency + rocket ledger, move financial state to Postgres (Graphile Worker for transactional enqueue); keep Redis for cache/rate-limit/scratch.

Bypassable via the "using Cloudflare to bypass Cloudflare" attack (Certitude) — attacker proxies through their own CF zone. Use AOP with per-zone cert (NOT the shared CF cert).

For the worker process group set kill_timeout=300, kill_signal=SIGTERM, auto_stop_machines=false, use CMD ["node", ...] (NOT npm start — shell parents swallow signals), and write a drain handler that stops accepting QStash deliveries, checkpoints in-flight Claude calls, then server.close() with a 10s failsafe.

Recovery codes in Postgres, not Redis (must survive Redis failover). NO email magic-link fallback (defeats phishing resistance).
