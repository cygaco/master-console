# MC Launch Guides — for total newbies

> You built (or are building) an app and you're ready to launch it **for real** — accounts, sign-in, data, email, payments, privacy. These guides walk you through each piece in plain language, from zero, assuming little or no technical background.
>
> **How to use:** skim this page, then open the guide you need. Each guide is self-contained — **but read Section 0 and the day-zero rule below once**; they apply to *every* guide.

## 0. What only YOU (the human) can do vs your AI assistant

Your AI coding assistant is great at **writing and wiring the code**. But across every guide, a set of steps can **only be done by you**, because they need *your* identity, *your* money, and *your* legal agreement:

| The kind of step | Who | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Create accounts (Google Cloud, Apple, Stripe, email provider, DB host…) | **YOU** | Logged in as *you*; tied to your identity |
| Pay fees / verify a bank or card | **YOU** | Your money, your legal contract |
| Pass identity / business verification (photo ID, D-U-N-S) | **YOU** | It's a check that *you* are real |
| Add DNS records, paste secrets/API keys, flip a service to "live" | **YOU** | Done in *your* dashboards, with *your* credentials |
| Publish a privacy policy / terms as real legal documents | **YOU** | You're the legal entity making the promise |
| Write the app code, config, schema, queries, login/payment/email wiring | **🤖 AI** | This is normal coding |

Throughout the guides: **🔴 YOU MUST DO THIS** = a step the AI can't do for you. **🤖 AI CAN DO THIS** = hand it back to your assistant.

> **🔑 Golden rule for newbies:** Never paste a **secret** — an API key, a "Client Secret", a signing password, a Stripe live key — into a public chat, a screenshot, or a file you'll commit to GitHub. Treat them like your house keys. Secrets live in environment variables / a secret manager, never in your code.

## ⏱️ The #1 rule: start the slow stuff on DAY ZERO

**This is the single most important lesson across all the guides.** Several launch steps have a **human/bureaucratic lead time you cannot speed up** — and newbies almost always discover them *after* the app is finished, turning a "ready to launch" moment into a multi-week wait:

| Slow thing | Where | Typical wait |
|---|---|---|
| Apple processes your $99 payment, *then* verifies you | DEV_SETUP | up to ~2 days for payment **+** 24–48 h verify |
| Google Play identity verification (manual review) | DEV_SETUP | hours → several days |
| Google Play **12-tester / 14-day closed test** (new personal accounts) | DEV_SETUP | **14+ days** |
| D-U-N-S number (organization accounts, Apple/Google) | DEV_SETUP | days → weeks |
| Stripe identity + bank verification before live payments | PAYMENTS | hours → days |
| Email **sending-domain DNS** (SPF/DKIM/DMARC) propagation + reputation warm-up | EMAIL | hours → days |
| Google "sensitive scope" OAuth verification (only if you request Gmail/Drive) | AUTH | days → weeks |

**So: kick off every account signup + verification the moment you start building** — let the clocks run in the background while you code. Do **not** save them for launch week. The setup is cheap; the **waiting is the real cost**, so start the waiting early.

## Recommended order of operations

1. **Day 1 — fire off the slow signups:** Apple Developer + Google Play (DEV_SETUP), and a Stripe account if you'll charge web/physical/outside-app purchases (PAYMENTS). Mobile in-app digital goods need StoreKit / Play Billing product setup instead. Org route? Apply for D-U-N-S first.
2. **Early & architectural:** pick your **database** (DATABASE) and your **auth approach** (AUTH) — these shape everything and are painful to swap later.
3. **As you build:** wire sign-in (AUTH); set up your **email** sending domain (EMAIL) so verification/magic-link mail isn't in spam.
4. **Before you collect real user data / launch:** privacy policy + consent + data export/delete (PRIVACY_GDPR).
5. **When you monetize:** web/physical/outside-app payments use Stripe checkout + subscriptions + webhooks, verified in **test mode** first; mobile in-app digital goods use StoreKit / Play Billing + server-side entitlement verification (PAYMENTS).
6. **Launch:** Apple review + Google Play production (after the 14-day test).
