# AUTH_RUNBOOK.md — Passwordless auth on Supabase (product-agnostic, agent-drivable)

> **This is the *execution runbook*, not the *decision guide*.** Still choosing an approach (Clerk vs
> Supabase, password vs passwordless, Apple sign-in)? Read **`AUTH_GUIDE.md`** first — it covers the
> method-choice for a human founder. **This** doc assumes the choice is made: **passwordless Supabase
> (6-digit email code + Google), no passwords, ever.** It is written so an **AI agent can drive the
> whole setup autonomously**, with the operator-only steps fenced (🔴 OPERATOR = only a human can do it;
> 🤖 AGENT = the AI does it). The MC app-scaffold ships the code half of this (clients, sign-in UI,
> PKCE callback, the §9 password hard-block migration + verifier); this runbook is the config half.

## 0. Placeholders (fill these first)

| Placeholder | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `{{PRODUCT}}` | Brand name as users see it | `doogle` |
| `{{APEX}}` | Production apex domain | `doogle.dog` |
| `{{AUTH_HOST}}` | Custom auth subdomain (§7, optional) | `auth.doogle.dog` |
| `{{REF}}` | Supabase project ref | `uvsbtpcziogndopgmihu` |
| `{{ORG}}` | Supabase org slug (billing URLs) | — |
| `{{SENDER}}` | Sign-in email sender | `sign-in@{{APEX}}` |

**Secrets** (store in `.env.local`, NEVER commit): `sbp_…` Supabase Management token, Resend `re_…`,
Google OAuth client id/secret. The scaffold's `.env.local.example` lists the variable *names* only.

## 1. Philosophy (4 rules)

1. **Passwordless-first.** Only two sign-in methods: a **6-digit email code** and **"Continue with
   Google."** No password anywhere — hard-blocked at the database (§9).
2. **The code IS the confirmation.** No separate "confirm your email" link — entering the code proves
   inbox ownership (mechanism: Supabase "Confirm email" **OFF**, §6).
3. **Sign-up-first.** One email-code flow serves new + returning users (auto-create on first request).
4. **Never lose access.** No password to forget; a lost inbox → Google is the second door.

## 2. Auth methods (only two)

1. **Email OTP code** — `signInWithOtp({ email })` sends a 6-digit code; verify with
   `verifyOtp({ email, token, type:'email' })`.
2. **Google OAuth** — `signInWithOAuth({ provider:'google', options:{ redirectTo } })`.

No `signInWithPassword` / `signUp(email, password)` anywhere. The scaffold ships this constraint by
construction — the §9 migration nulls any password at the DB.

## 3. Client architecture — variant A ships by default

The scaffold ships **variant A** (browser client, `@supabase/ssr`, tokens in cookies managed by the
lib) — simplest, production-proven:

- `src/lib/supabase/config.ts` — `isSupabaseConfigured()` gate + env reads.
- `src/lib/supabase/client.ts` — browser client; **returns `null` when unconfigured** (so `next build`
  never breaks on a scaffold with no Supabase project — mirrors the telemetry seam).
- `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` — server client (`await cookies()`, Next 16; `getAll`/`setAll` adapter).
- `src/app/auth/callback/route.ts` — PKCE `exchangeCodeForSession` (sanitizes `?next=`, `no-store`).
- `src/middleware.ts` + `src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts` — session refresh (no-op when unconfigured;
  writes cookies onto the same response it returns; uses `getUser()` not `getSession()`).

**Variant B (server-proxied, httpOnly cookies)** — a documented **swap-in** (not shipped) for a higher
security bar (no JS-readable token): move the `signInWithOtp`/`verifyOtp` calls into a
`/api/auth/session` route handler; set the session cookie `httpOnly` server-side; the page POSTs
`{email}` then `{email, token}` and reads whoami via GET. The `config.ts` seam is unchanged — only the
call-site moves.

**Both variants:** OAuth stays a browser redirect; `/auth/callback` exchanges the PKCE code. Redirects
derive from `window.location.origin`, **never hardcoded**; `?next=` is sanitized to a relative path.
**Never let a service worker cache `/api/*`** (a cached whoami produced a real sign-in bug).

## 4. ★ The sign-up-first + code pattern (no confirm email) — the core flow

ONE flow serves brand-new and returning users; no separate registration, no "check your email to
confirm" dead-end, no password.

```
user enters email
  → signInWithOtp({ email })            # Supabase AUTO-CREATES the user if new ("sign-up-first")
  → email arrives with a 6-DIGIT CODE   # not a link — §5.1 template renders {{ .Token }}
  → user types the code into the app
  → verifyOtp({ email, token, type: 'email' })
  → session established; a new user is now BOTH confirmed AND signed in
```

Why no confirm-email step: **entering the code IS the confirmation.** Needs two Supabase settings
together: (1) **"Confirm email" = OFF** (§6) and (2) the Magic Link template renders **`{{ .Token }}`**
not `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}` (§5.1). Verify `type:'email'` for everyone.

**Safety:** sign-up-first + Confirm-email-OFF is safe **only** paired with the §9 password hard-block.
An attacker who "signs up" someone else's address gets nothing — they can't receive the code, and the
real owner's later sign-in takes over the empty, passwordless row.

### UI copy (the scaffold ships this)
"Create your account" → email field → **"Email me a code"** (primary) → 6-box code entry
(`inputMode=numeric`, `autoComplete="one-time-code"`, `maxLength=6`, auto-submit on the 6th digit) →
signed in. "Continue with Google" secondary. "Already have an account? **Log in**" toggles the copy
only.

## 5. Email delivery (code arrives, from your domain)

### 5.1 The link-vs-code flip (the classic signup bug)
`{{ .ConfirmationURL }}` = link (stock default); **`{{ .Token }}`** = the 6-digit code.
1. Auth → Emails → **Magic Link** template: render `{{ .Token }}` (large, monospace); put it in the
   subject too: `{{ .Token }} is your {{PRODUCT}} sign-in code`.
2. **"Confirm email" OFF** (§6) — else NEW signups route through the "Confirm signup" **link** template.
   **Trap: an EXISTING user shows a code; a NEW user still gets a link until this is OFF.**
3. Auth → Providers → Email: **OTP length = 6** (default 8 breaks a 6-box input), expiry ~10 min.

### 5.2 SMTP via Resend
Auth → Emails → SMTP: host `smtp.resend.com`, port `465`, user `resend`, sender `{{SENDER}}`,
password = Resend API key. 🔴 OPERATOR creates the Resend account.

### 5.3 Sending-domain DNS — find where the zone ACTUALLY lives first
**⚠ registrar ≠ DNS host.** `nslookup -type=NS {{APEX}}` before touching any panel. Records (from
Resend): MX `send` → `feedback-smtp.<region>.amazonses.com` (prio 10); TXT `send` →
`v=spf1 include:amazonses.com ~all`; TXT `resend._domainkey` → DKIM; TXT `_dmarc` →
`v=DMARC1; p=none;`. Then Verify in Resend.

## 6. "Confirm email" OFF — the crux

Auth → Providers → Email → **Confirm email = OFF.** **Safe ONLY together with the §9 password
hard-block** — the only thing OFF loosens is password signups (auto-confirmed), and §9 removes that path
entirely. Config-first ordering: if the app shipped a two-type fallback (`type:'signup'` vs `'email'`),
collapse it to uniform `type:'email'` **after** the toggle, not before.

## 7. Custom auth domain — OPTIONAL, operator-gated, DEFERRABLE

Runs OAuth + auth emails on `{{AUTH_HOST}}` instead of `{{REF}}.supabase.co`. **Deferrable** — auth
works fully on `{{REF}}.supabase.co` without it. Gated on the operator buying the **Custom Domain
add-on (~$10/mo)**; until then custom-hostname calls return `entitlement_required` + an upgrade URL —
surface it and wait. Flow (🤖 once bought): `POST /v1/projects/{{REF}}/custom-hostname/initialize`
`{"custom_hostname":"{{AUTH_HOST}}"}` → DNS (CNAME `auth`→`{{REF}}.supabase.co` **DNS-only on
Cloudflare**, ownership TXT, ACME TXT) → `POST /reverify` every ~90s until `ssl.status:"active"` →
`POST /activate`. Then 🔴 add `https://{{AUTH_HOST}}/auth/v1/callback` to Google, 🤖 set
`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://{{AUTH_HOST}}` + redeploy. **Cloudflare CNAME must be DNS-only**
(proxying breaks validation). Stuck at `2_initiated`/`does not CNAME to this zone` while CNAME visible +
SSL active = checked while briefly Proxied (`moved`, stale reverify): `DELETE /custom-hostname` →
re-init (new UUID) → reverify → activate. Polling: healthy = literal `"errors":[]`; don't grep bare
`error`.

## 8. Google consent-screen branding — LATER (do §7 first)

Once the custom domain is live the consent screen reads "continue to {{AUTH_HOST}}" (acceptable
immediately). App-name branding (Console → OAuth consent screen: App name, support email, logo,
home/privacy/terms, Authorized domain → Publish) is polish and may sit behind Google brand-verification
— **do NOT block rollout on it.** All Google Console steps are 🔴 OPERATOR (agents have no Google Cloud
access; supply exact values).

## 9. Security: the password hard-block (what makes §6 safe) — SHIPPED + GATED

The scaffold ships `supabase/migrations/0001_password_hardblock.sql` — a **BEFORE INSERT/UPDATE trigger
on `auth.users`** that nulls `encrypted_password`, killing the anon-key password-signup surface (the
Sudhodanan & Paverd pre-account-takeover class) — **plus a fail-closed predeploy verifier**
(`scripts/verify-auth-hardblock.mjs`, run via `npm run verify:auth`):

- STATIC mode (no DB) asserts the trigger *definition* is correct (the function nulls
  `NEW.encrypted_password` AND the `CREATE TRIGGER … ON auth.users … FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION`
  binding). A static-only pass is reported **`PROVEN=STATIC-ONLY`, not "installed"**, and exits
  **non-zero by default** — static is NOT proof of installation. (Static validates the shipped
  single-trigger migration; a hand-edited multi-trigger migration should rely on LIVE-mode
  installed-proof below, which inspects every trigger actually on `auth.users`.)
- LIVE mode (`SUPABASE_DB_URL` set) proves the EXACT shipped hard-block is installed AND effective —
  an *allowlist of the one valid shape via whole-definition EQUALITY*, not token/keyword parsing (which
  is a denylist against a grammar — a `WHEN`-clause or a probe-aware conditional body defeats token
  checks). Installed-proof requires: a trigger named `hardblock_password_trigger` present + **enabled**
  (`tgenabled ∈ {O,A}` — disabled/replica-only rejected), its normalized `pg_get_triggerdef` **equal to**
  the shipped trigger definition, and its function's normalized `pg_get_functiondef` **equal to** the
  shipped `public.hardblock_password` definition (normalization canonicalizes whitespace/case/comments/
  dollar-quote tags — robust to benign rendering, exact on substance). Behavioral negative tests on
  **both** INSERT and UPDATE (randomized sentinels, rollback txn) are defense-in-depth. Anything short
  of the exact shape → `ok:false`. Only this exits 0 as installed-proof; a missing `pg` dependency fails
  closed (never skips to green).

> **⛔ MANDATORY ADOPTION GATE:** never ship an auth-enabled build without
> `SUPABASE_DB_URL=… npm run verify:auth` GREEN against your live project. The framework-time tests
> validate the verifier's *logic* (present-fixture → green, absent-fixture → red); the *safety property*
> is realized only when the verifier runs against your **live Supabase project** at deploy. Wire it as a
> required predeploy CI step.

Do NOT reintroduce password UI; app-side password-rotate revokes the session (GoTrue #1579).

## 10. Environment

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://{{AUTH_HOST}}      # after §7; {{REF}}.supabase.co before
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=sb_publishable_…      # "publishable key" — safe in client
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=sb_secret_…               # "secret key" — server-only
SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=sbp_…                         # Management API — never commit
SUPABASE_DB_URL=postgresql://…                       # verifier live mode (§9); optional
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=… / GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=…
RESEND_API_KEY=re_…
```
Key-name mapping: dashboard "publishable" = anon, "secret" = service-role. A raw `apikey`-header curl
401s with the new key format = wrong call shape, not a bad key. **When any Supabase var is unset the
scaffold auth seam no-ops — the app still builds and runs; the auth UI shows an "auth not configured"
state.**

## 11. Agent-autonomy map (who does what)

| Step | Owner | Why |
|---|---|---|
| All Supabase config (templates, Confirm-email, OTP length, SMTP) | 🤖 AGENT via Management API (`PATCH /v1/projects/{{REF}}/config/auth`) | token suffices |
| Custom-hostname initialize/reverify/activate (§7) | 🤖 AGENT | token suffices |
| DNS records | 🤖 AGENT (API, or browser with the operator's live login) | never enters credentials |
| Plan/add-on purchase, Resend account creation | 🔴 OPERATOR | purchases are operator-only |
| Google Cloud Console (consent screen, redirect URIs) | 🔴 OPERATOR (agent supplies exact values) | no agent access |
| Vercel env + deploy | 🤖 AGENT (if CLI/token wired) | |
| Live E2E proof (new-user code, returning, Google, lost-inbox) | 🤖 AGENT drives, 🔴 OPERATOR receives the code email | inbox access |

### 11.5 ★ Executable Management-API config (🤖 AGENT drives this inline)

> The agent drives Supabase config by FOLLOWING these calls — no separate driver script is shipped this
> release (that idempotent-driver packaging is **deferred, tracked debt** — see §14). "Agent-drivable"
> means these calls are precise enough to execute directly.

**Base:** `https://api.supabase.com/v1/projects/{{REF}}/config/auth`, header
`Authorization: Bearer $SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

**Step 1 — READ current config + assert the trap isn't set:**
```
GET /v1/projects/{{REF}}/config/auth
```
Assert in the response: `mailer_autoconfirm == true` (this is Confirm-email **OFF** — if `false`, the
§5.1 link-vs-code trap is live), `mailer_otp_length == 6`, `external_google_enabled == true`,
`site_url == https://{{APEX}}`, and `uri_allow_list` contains `https://{{APEX}}/auth/callback`,
`https://{{APEX}}/account`, AND their `www.` variants (`https://www.{{APEX}}/…`). A missing `www.`
variant fails redirects silently.

**Step 2 — PATCH the passwordless config:**
```
PATCH /v1/projects/{{REF}}/config/auth
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "mailer_autoconfirm": true,               // Confirm email OFF (§6) — new+returning both get the code
  "mailer_otp_length": 6,                   // 6-digit (default 8 breaks the 6-box input)
  "mailer_otp_exp": 600,                    // ~10 min
  "external_google_enabled": true,
  "site_url": "https://{{APEX}}",
  "uri_allow_list": "https://{{APEX}}/auth/callback,https://{{APEX}}/account,https://www.{{APEX}}/auth/callback,https://www.{{APEX}}/account"
}
```

**Step 3 — Magic Link template + SMTP (same `PATCH /config/auth` endpoint):**
```
PATCH /v1/projects/{{REF}}/config/auth
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "mailer_subjects_magic_link": "{{ .Token }} is your {{PRODUCT}} sign-in code",
  "mailer_templates_magic_link_content": "<p>Your {{PRODUCT}} sign-in code:</p><p style=\"font-size:28px;font-family:monospace;letter-spacing:4px\">{{ .Token }}</p>",
  "smtp_host": "smtp.resend.com",
  "smtp_port": 465,
  "smtp_user": "resend",
  "smtp_pass": "<RESEND_API_KEY>",
  "smtp_sender_name": "{{PRODUCT}}",
  "smtp_admin_email": "{{SENDER}}"
}
```
The template body MUST render **`{{ .Token }}`**, NOT `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}` (§5.1 — else a NEW user
gets a link, not a code). **FALLBACK (dashboard/manual):** if a field name differs in your Supabase
Management-API version, these exact settings also live in the dashboard — **Auth → Emails → Magic Link**
(template + subject) and **Auth → Emails → SMTP** (host/port/user/pass/sender). Both write the same
config; the dashboard is the authoritative manual path when the API field shape is uncertain. (The
Resend *account* + sending-domain DNS remain per §5.2–5.3; this step only wires Supabase → Resend.)

**Step 4 — re-GET and re-assert** the Step-1 invariants now hold. Polling any custom-hostname state
(§7): a healthy response contains the literal `"errors":[]` — match that exact token, never grep bare
`error` (it false-positives your own watchdog).

### 11.6 Ordered checklist (agent executes top-to-bottom)
1. `GET /config/auth` — verify the §11.5 Step-1 assertions.
2. `PATCH /config/auth` + Magic Link template (§11.5 Steps 2–3).
3. Resend SMTP + sending DNS (§5.2–5.3).
4. Custom domain (§7) — gated on the operator's add-on purchase.
5. Consent screen + redirect URI (§8, operator, agent supplies values).
6. Env swap + deploy + live E2E proof + `SUPABASE_DB_URL=… npm run verify:auth` GREEN (§9 gate).
7. Post-config cleanup: collapse any two-type OTP fallback to uniform `type:'email'` (§6).

## 12. Verification commands

```bash
nslookup -type=NS {{APEX}} 8.8.8.8                           # where does the zone live?
nslookup -type=TXT _cf-custom-hostname.{{AUTH_HOST}} 8.8.8.8 # ownership TXT propagated?
nslookup -type=TXT _acme-challenge.{{AUTH_HOST}} 8.8.8.8     # ACME TXT propagated?
nslookup {{AUTH_HOST}} 8.8.8.8                               # CNAME resolves to supabase?
curl -s https://{{AUTH_HOST}}/auth/v1/health                 # auth server answers on the brand domain
SUPABASE_DB_URL=… npm run verify:auth                        # §9 password hard-block, installed-proof
```

## 13. What the MC scaffold ships vs what you configure

**Ships (framework-time, app-scaffold):** the two Supabase clients + config seam (no-op when unset), the
sign-up-first sign-in UI (§4) + account page, the PKCE `/auth/callback` + session middleware, the §9
password hard-block migration + fail-closed verifier + negative-fixture test, the env-var names, and
this runbook.

**You configure (product-time, per §11):** a real Supabase project + keys, Confirm-email-OFF + the
`{{ .Token }}` template (§5.1/§6), Resend + sending DNS, the optional custom domain (§7), Google Console
(§8), the live E2E proof, and the §9 verifier GREEN against your live DB. The scaffold compiles and runs
before any of this; auth activates when you fill the env.

## 14. Deferred (honest debt — not in this release)

- **Idempotent Management-API driver script** — the §11.5 calls are executed inline by the agent this
  release; a packaged `configure-supabase-auth` driver (retry/idempotency/DRY) is a reliability
  optimization, deferred.
- **Custom auth domain §7 + consent branding §8** — product-adoption-time, operator-purchase-gated.
- **Variant B (server-proxied)** — documented swap-in (§3), not shipped.
- **Live E2E harness** — the new-user/returning/Google/lost-inbox proof is a per-product step (§11), not
  a framework artifact.
